Flashcards_Java
===============

Boredom has caused me to learn Java basics by translating the previous Python project.

---

I suppose my goals for this project are the same as the one done in Python. I'd also like to see if I can implement this any better. Since I'm back in school, I've been trying to see how far I can get by putting in 40 minutes a day.

---

Todo (because I forget where I leave off):
- Test undo()/redo() after history overwrite.
- Research Java regular expressions.
- Try to allow user to set symbols other than Q#/A# and try allow delimiter or ending symbol. 
		(like "Q#This is a question#Q but this is not apart of the A#Answer#A")
